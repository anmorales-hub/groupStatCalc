<h1>Group Stats Calculator Project</h1>
<h4>Group project for IS218 - Andrey Morales (anmorales-hub) and Kofi Otu-Manteaw (Paakofi62)</h4>

This project utilizes Docker and unittests to ensure that the code functions properly. Docker is used to create a container that imports modules such as numpy and scipy, as well as the unittests themselves. Travis-ci implemented to keep track of the program's build state.

See [tests](https://github.com/anmorales-hub/groupStatCalc/tree/master/Tests) to view the tests used for each function.

See the [Task Assignment Project](https://github.com/anmorales-hub/groupStatCalc/projects/1) of this repository to view the descriptions and formulas of each function used.
